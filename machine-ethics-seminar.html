    <h1>Machine Ethics Seminar</h1>
    <p>Covers cutting-edge research related to building moral AI systems. Iowa course listing <a href="https://myui.uiowa.edu/my-ui/courses/details.page?ci=158619&id=1061297">here</a>.</p>
    <h3>Course Description</h3>
    <p>This is a seminar covering Machine Ethics, a recent and growing subfield of AI/Cognitive Science that is aimed at computationally modeling ethics to 1) better understand ethics and 2) ensure that AI systems are ethical. This is an important task as AI systems are being deployed in risky domains like law, healthcare, and the military. Being a seminar, you will spend time reading and reflecting on cutting-edge technical and philosophical papers.</p>
    <p>Our main question(s) will be: How can we formally model ethics (via symbols & rules, vectors, etc.) and should we? Where "formally" here means "described in a way that it can be run as an algorithm and thus used in AI systems." In this context, we will cover (at least) the following topics:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Moral philosophy e.g., deontology & consequentialism</
      <li>Cognitive modeling</li>
      <li>Symbolic AI e.g., deontic logics</li>
      <li>Statistical AI e.g., guard-rails for neutral networks like LLMs.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Learning Outcomes</h3>
    <p>At the end of the semester, students should have the knowledge to explore aspects of machine ethics in their own research and analyze AI techniques in other courses with a critical lens. Specifically, by the end of this course students should:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Be capable of reading research papers in the fields of AI, cognitive science, and philosophy</li>
      <li>Understand, at a high-level, theories in moral philosophy and their pros/cons</li>
      <li>Understand current computational techniques in machine ethics</li>
      <li>Understand arguments for/against machine ethics and have formulated their own opinion on the topic</li>
      <li>Be capable of analyzing cognitive models WRT their theoretical assumptions, representations, processes, and performance</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These are all useful research skills and are sought out by top universities and companies working in AI, law, and more.</p>
    <h3>Course Schedule</h3>
    <p>There is NO textbook for this course. Each week we will be reading and discussing research papers. A rough calendar for the course is provided below.</p>
